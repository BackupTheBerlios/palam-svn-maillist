 Web Based Translation / Translator Management Application
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
-Features that we must have --
+We are looking at building a web based translator / translation
+management application. These days, i18n / l10n projects mostly get
+translations done from translators by exchanging PO files via Email
+which is not only slow, but also a very cumbersome process. It doesn't
+allow the project admin to track changes to the PO file and also has no
+scope to track contributions from a given translator. Moreover, with so
+many projects to be translated and so few people participating, it's
+impractical to translate most common strings automatically. There should
+also be a way to remember translations so as to save time in further
+translations and also assure a certain level of consistency of
+translations among all applications. The major issues that are being
+faced by most l10n groups today can be summarised as below --
 
-* Web based translation
-	-- Multi team
-	-- Multi language
-	-- Multi products
-    
-* Support for all types of keymaps
+* Lack of consistency among translations
+* Lack of any translation memory
+* Inefficient use of human resources
+* Lack of decent machine translation facilities
+* Lack of versioning information in translations
+* Mostly complicated translation tools
+* Desktop or web based apps are the only ways to do translation
+* Lack of a coordinated effort among different teams
+* There is no way to contribute in small parts
+* No easy way to get the PO files as and when required
+* No new contributors are coming up
+* The overall process of getting something translated is too long
 
-isnt this browser based? as long as the keymaps produce the standard unicode strings, this is irrelevant
+To solve the above problems and to make the l10n work much smoother, we
+are proposing a web based application which will also act as a
+centralised repository of all Indic l10n work. It will act as the
+ultimate resource for all l10n volunteers. People will be able to
+contribute their translations in a very easy and user friendly way. The
+web based tool intends to achieve the following --
 
-* Way to incorporate daily updates in the POT straight from upstream
-  CVS/SVN
-  
-svn+trac
-  
-* There should be a way to download tarballs of all PO files
+* Act as a central repository of all Indic translations across all
+  products / languages.
+* Make the job of the translator much easier by providing a web based
+  interface.
+* Make reviewing easy by clearly separating the reviewed and unreviewed
+  messages [Once click access to unreviewed strings].
+* Make it easy for beginners to contribute to the IndLinux project.
+* Always provide up to date POT files by monitoring upstream changes.
+* Make sure translations are never lost.
+* Make it easy for new / small language teams to start translating.
+* Provide an email interface
+* Shorten the translation &lt;-&gt; review -&gt; commit process
 
-please dump the contents of your original mail proposing the project here, and we can work on it
+TODO: Fix the text and add some more points [must write around 1k words].
