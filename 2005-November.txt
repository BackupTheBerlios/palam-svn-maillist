+Proposal for an Integrated Translation Management Application
+
+Synopsis: 
+
+Translation of open source applications - like open source
+applications themselves, depend on the whims of would-be translators. There
+is a need for an application that will both cater to the need of individual
+translators to 'scratch their itch' and translate as much as they want of
+portions they want and at the same time allow the application developer to
+coordinate the efforts of individuals and maintain an adequate level of
+accuracy and consistency. 
+
+The application should cater to both sporadic or
+'one-off' online translation efforts and more consistent off-line efforts.
+
+In addition the application should build a basic database of strings with
+translations in the languages catered to - and offer either automatic
+translation of strings already in the database, or hints for already
+translated strings.
+
+The application should, at a later stage cater to translation of
+documentation - which has to be served to the translator para or section
+wise unlike translation of source which is served string by string.
+
+It goes without saying that the application should be free software,
+multiplatform and multilingual. It is also clear that any such application
+has to be web based.
+
+Existing efforts:
+
+We have investigated Rosetta, Pootle and Entrans (put the URLs). Rosetta is
+proprietory software. Pootle, written in python has the idea correct, but
+it uses a filesystem to store everything and probably wont scale. Entrans
+uses php and mysql, which we feel are not stable or secure enough for an
+application of this nature - and from the documentation does not appear to
+have the comprehensive aims of this project. However elements of it's user
+interface are good and could be incorporated into this project.
+
+Platform:
+
+We propose using the Python scripting language with Postgresql RDBMS as a
+backend. The webserver will be Apache. We will be using other tools and
+frameworks not limited to django, subversion, plone and trac for scripting
+various parts of the project. Both Python and Postgresql are stable, mature and
+inherently secure and used worldwide on an immense range of products and
+applications. Further, python being an easy to master scripting language,
+more non-technical people will be encouraged to hack at and contribute to
+the project.

+
+* Statistics -- Must have  
+
+* Online Review -- Must have
+
+* Consistency Checking -- Must have
+
+* Version Control -- A basic form of VC should be there, nothing too
+  ambitious, but there will be a way to mark a PO file to be a part of x
+  version of y app while uploading. The app will in any case treat PO
+  files of different version as separate files. So in a way, the VC will
+  be at a higher level than the app itself

+Workflow:
 
+The Application developer registers an application and uploads the POT file.
+He also gives the file version. The application will treat each version of the
+PO file as a different file. The developer may opt for automatic
+translation, in which case all the strings available in the database will
+be translated into all the languages available and saved as drafts.
+Similarly, any translation by a non authorised translator will also be
+saved as drafts as and when they are done. The developer, and anyone
+authorised by him can approve of drafts, wholly or partially and merge them
+into the official version. This official version will be presented to all
+translators who wish to translate the file wholly or partially.
 
+All translations of strings in all official versions will be added to the
+database. In case of more than one translation of a string into a given
+lanuguage, all translations will be added and it is left to individual
+developers to choose the one they want.
 
+There will be a facility for experts in particular languages to review the
+database and cull out obviously incorrect translations, correct spellings,
+mark any one translation as 'preferred' and remove almost identical duplic
+ates. 
 
+Translators will be able to use the online interface as well as upload
+translations made offline. Submitting translations by email will also be
+catered to, but this will not have an automatic interface. The developer
+will have to accept responsibility for accepting email submissions and the
+translator will have to get the consent of the developer to submit my

+Proposed Features:
+------------------
 
-* Statistics -- Must have  
+Statistics:
 
-* Online Review -- Must have
+The application will provide detailed statistics of the number of
+strings translated. This can also be filtered according to the project,
+language, translator as well as different project versions.
 
-* Consistency Checking -- Must have
+Online Review:
 
-* Version Control -- A basic form of VC should be there, nothing too

+An system for reviewing the translations online will be present so as to
+help trusted reviewers to just login to the system and review the
+translations. 
 
+Consistency Checking:
 
+The application will automatically check the consistency of the
+translations and will report errors if any for fixes. In case of a
+broken translation, the official version will be switched to the last
+sane translation until the broken [but newer] version is fixed and
+committed.
 
-* Downloads -- A way to filter translations according to language,
-  product, etc. and download tarballs
+Version Control:
 
-* Minor Points
-  -- Translated UI
-  -- Extensive Online Documentation
-  -- Email Interface
-  -- Screenshot Gallery (?)
+A basic form of version control will be present in the app. It will be
+able to track translations of the same application across different
+versions and will also allow merging & diffing between the
+versions. Also, it will make sure translations are never lost.
 
-* TODO -- Think of more features to put in  
+Downloads:
 
+Translators will be able to download tarballs of translated files
+according to projects, project versions and languages. This will help in
+case they want to translate offline.
+
+Translated UI:
+
+The UI of the application itself will be translated into various indian
+langauges so as to allow translators use the application in their own
+native language.
+
+Extensive Online Documentation:
+
+Documentation is very important in a project and we will provide an
+extensive documentation for the application so that it's easy for the
+translators / admins to pick it up and start using.
+
+Email Interface:
+
+As already pointed out, we intend to provide an Email interface to the
+application so that authenticated translators can recieve untranslated
+strings and send translations by Email.
+
+Screenshot Gallery:
+
+There will be a screenhot gallery which will have screenshots of various
+translated applications to inspire more people to join the i18n / l10n
+scene as well as to show the status of translations for a particular
+language / project.
