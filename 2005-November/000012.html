+Proposal for an Integrated Translation Management Application
+
+Synopsis: 
+
+Translation of open source applications - like open source
+applications themselves, depend on the whims of would-be translators. There
+is a need for an application that will both cater to the need of individual
+translators to 'scratch their itch' and translate as much as they want of
+portions they want and at the same time allow the application developer to
+coordinate the efforts of individuals and maintain an adequate level of
+accuracy and consistency. 
+
+The application should cater to both sporadic or
+'one-off' online translation efforts and more consistent off-line efforts.
+
+In addition the application should build a basic database of strings with
+translations in the languages catered to - and offer either automatic
+translation of strings already in the database, or hints for already
+translated strings.
+
+The application should, at a later stage cater to translation of
+documentation - which has to be served to the translator para or section
+wise unlike translation of source which is served string by string.
+
+It goes without saying that the application should be free software,
+multiplatform and multilingual. It is also clear that any such application
+has to be web based.
+
+Existing efforts:
+
+We have investigated Rosetta, Pootle and Entrans (put the URLs). Rosetta is
+proprietory software. Pootle, written in python has the idea correct, but
+it uses a filesystem to store everything and probably wont scale. Entrans
+uses php and mysql, which we feel are not stable or secure enough for an
+application of this nature - and from the documentation does not appear to
+have the comprehensive aims of this project. However elements of it's user
+interface are good and could be incorporated into this project.
+
+Platform:
+
+We propose using the Python scripting language with Postgresql RDBMS as a
+backend. The webserver will be Apache. We will be using other tools and
+frameworks not limited to django, subversion, plone and trac for scripting
+various parts of the project. Both Python and Postgresql are stable, mature and
+inherently secure and used worldwide on an immense range of products and
+applications. Further, python being an easy to master scripting language,
+more non-technical people will be encouraged to hack at and contribute to
+the project.
+
+
+
+
+
+
+
+* Statistics -- Must have  
+
+* Online Review -- Must have
+
+* Consistency Checking -- Must have
+
+* Version Control -- A basic form of VC should be there, nothing too
+  ambitious, but there will be a way to mark a PO file to be a part of x
+  version of y app while uploading. The app will in any case treat PO
+  files of different version as separate files. So in a way, the VC will
+  be at a higher level than the app itself
+
+* User Profiles -- Unnecessary
+
+* Management Console -- Not needed as volunteers will be able to take up
+  work via the stats page itself
+
+* Downloads -- A way to filter translations according to language,
+  product, etc. and download tarballs
+
+* Minor Points
+  -- Translated UI
+  -- Extensive Online Documentation
+  -- Email Interface
+  -- Screenshot Gallery (?)
+
+* TODO -- Think of more features to put in  
+
