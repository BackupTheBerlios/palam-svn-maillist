 It was also decided that we will try to hack on the Entrans JavaScript
 code to do the keymaps and integrate with our app. We'll acknowledge

-We have to state why we are doing a separate project and not joining an existing one:
-rosetta: not free
-pootle: in python, but no rdbms backend, so will not scale wordforge site itself seems to be broken.
