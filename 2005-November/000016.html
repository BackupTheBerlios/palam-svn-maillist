 Proposal for an Integrated Translation Management Application
+-------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Synopsis: 
 
-Translation of open source applications - like open source
-applications themselves, depend on the whims of would-be translators. There
-is a need for an application that will both cater to the need of individual
-translators to 'scratch their itch' and translate as much as they want of
-portions they want and at the same time allow the application developer to
-coordinate the efforts of individuals and maintain an adequate level of
-accuracy and consistency.

 The application should, at a later stage cater to translation of
 documentation - which has to be served to the translator para or section
 wise unlike translation of source which is served string by string.
 
 It goes without saying that the application should be free software,
-multiplatform and multilingual. It is also clear that any such application

 Existing efforts:
 
-We have investigated Rosetta, Pootle and Entrans (put the URLs). Rosetta is
-proprietory software. Pootle, written in python has the idea correct, but
-it uses a filesystem to store everything and probably wont scale. Entrans
-uses php and mysql, which we feel are not stable or secure enough for an
-application of this nature - and from the documentation does not appear to
-have the comprehensive aims of this project. However elements of it's user
-interface are good and could be incorporated into this project.

 Platform:
 
-We propose using the Python scripting language with Postgresql RDBMS as a
-backend. The webserver will be Apache. We will be using other tools and
-frameworks not limited to django, subversion, plone and trac for scripting
-various parts of the project. Both Python and Postgresql are stable, mature and
-inherently secure and used worldwide on an immense range of products and
-applications. Further, python being an easy to master scripting language,
-more non-technical people will be encouraged to hack at and contribute to
-the project.

-other bits left for GNUlinuxer to do:
+Proposed Features:
+------------------
 
-* Statistics -- Must have  
+Statistics:
 
-* Online Review -- Must have
+The application will provide detailed statistics of the number of
+strings translated. This can also be filtered according to the project,
+language, translator as well as different project versions.
 
-* Consistency Checking -- Must have
+Online Review:
 
-* Version Control -- A basic form of VC should be there, nothing too
-  ambitious, but there will be a way to mark a PO file to be a part of x
-  version of y app while uploading. The app will in any case treat PO
-  files of different version as separate files. So in a way, the VC will
-  be at a higher level than the app itself
+An system for reviewing the translations online will be present so as to
+help trusted reviewers to just login to the system and review the
+translations. 
 
+Consistency Checking:
 
+The application will automatically check the consistency of the
+translations and will report errors if any for fixes. In case of a
+broken translation, the official version will be switched to the last
+sane translation until the broken [but newer] version is fixed and
+committed.
 
-* Downloads -- A way to filter translations according to language,
-  product, etc. and download tarballs
+Version Control:
 
-* Minor Points
-  -- Translated UI
-  -- Extensive Online Documentation
-  -- Email Interface
-  -- Screenshot Gallery (?)
+A basic form of version control will be present in the app. It will be
+able to track translations of the same application across different
+versions and will also allow merging &amp; diffing between the
+versions. Also, it will make sure translations are never lost.
 
-* TODO -- Think of more features to put in  
+Downloads:
 
+Translators will be able to download tarballs of translated files
+according to projects, project versions and languages. This will help in
+case they want to translate offline.
+
+Translated UI:
+
+The UI of the application itself will be translated into various indian
+langauges so as to allow translators use the application in their own
+native language.
+
+Extensive Online Documentation:
+
+Documentation is very important in a project and we will provide an
+extensive documentation for the application so that it's easy for the
+translators / admins to pick it up and start using.
+
+Email Interface:
+
+As already pointed out, we intend to provide an Email interface to the
+application so that authenticated translators can recieve untranslated
+strings and send translations by Email.
+
+Screenshot Gallery:
+
+There will be a screenhot gallery which will have screenshots of various
+translated applications to inspire more people to join the i18n / l10n
+scene as well as to show the status of translations for a particular
+language / project.
+
 Schedule:
 
 We will have a server up and running with a basic version of the
 application within a month of starting the project. Working with active
 developers and translators, the application will be fine-tuned over a
-period of 6 months to a year.

-2. Can we ask for a couple of ibooks?
+2. We'll initially require 6 months funding to create the application
+   with the most important features. Preferably we'd like to receive an
+   additional 6 months of funding to incorporate more advanced features
+   like machine translation and other nifty things as well as doing a
+   lot of bug fixing and writing test cases, etc.
